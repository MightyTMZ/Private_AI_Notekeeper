Peter Thiel, the billionaire entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and author of Zero to One, has profoundly influenced how I view competition.


While most of us are conditioned to see competition as essential to success, Peter Thiel and I challenge this notion, asserting that true success comes from escaping competition entirely.

Competition Is for Losers (Even If You Are the Winner of It)
Thiel’s assertion that “competition is for losers” is provocative but insightful. Aside from the monopoly mindset, building unique businesses that dominate their niches, Thiel gave me a true wake-up call in another sense.

Young people, especially, are so drawn to competition and they see the “losers” as the people who can’t compete effectively enough.

“All you had to do was walk out the front door,“ Thiel explains about him leaving Sullivan & Cromwell, “but it was psychologically hard for people to do this because their identity was so wrapped up in the competitions they have won, the people they had beaten along the way that they could not even imagine doing anything different“.

Thiel ended his statement by asserting, “Competition is always this very two-edged thing. When you compete ferociously you will get better at that which you're competing on but you will always narrow your focus to beating the people around you and it often comes at this very high price of losing sight of what is more important or perhaps more valuable.“

I realized how easy it is to become consumed by competition and let it dictate your identity. Especially in the context of building my projects like OrbitView. Instead of defining success by outperforming others, I’ve shifted my focus to creating value that transcends the race. This mindset frees me to pursue innovative ideas without the constant pressure to compare or prove myself against others, allowing me to prioritize long-term impact over short-term wins.

In my opinion, losing sight of our ultimate vision in the process of competing with others is an ultimate failure and loss. Therefore, did you win the “competition”.

Differentiation
One of Thiel’s most enduring lessons is the importance of differentiation. He emphasizes that successful businesses are those that solve problems in ways no one else can.

First Principles Thinking
Break down the most complex problems into their most basic components and rethink them from the ground up.

This mindset has encouraged me question assumptions and challenge conventional wisdom.

Many people do not often realize that competition creates a vicious reinforcement cycle of the “norms”. The way I think about this is: when everyone is competing to win within established frameworks, they unintentionally solidify those frameworks as unchangeable truths, stifling creativity and making it harder to think outside the box.

By adopting first principles thinking, I have learned to strip away these preconceptions and focus on the underlying truths of a problem which is truly the way for me and anyone to devise truly innovative solutions.

The Value of Secrets
In Zero to One, Thiel asks, “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” This question underscores the value of secrets—undiscovered opportunities that others overlook or dismiss.

Throughout my time exploring industries like generative AI, and tokenization, I have continuously asked myself the question to force myself to explore niche areas and ways to provide value that others have not yet considered.

Think Long-Term
Competition often forces businesses into short-term thinking. Thiel advises entrepreneurs to take a long-term perspective. Monopolistic businesses thrive because they can afford to invest in their future without worrying about immediate threats.

The question isn’t whether you can win the competition; it’s whether you can create something so unique that competition becomes irrelevant.
